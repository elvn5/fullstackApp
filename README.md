#Description

This is a fullstack application was built on the next stack of technologies:

:white_check_mark: MongoDB
:white_check_mark: Express.js
:white_check_mark: React.js
:white_check_mark: Node.js

# Available scripts:
____
In directory "server"

`yarn start/npm run start` to start backend server.

In directory "/"

`yarn start` to start frontend side on development server.

It was exciting experience for me to develop both frontend and backend parts by myself. If you have any suggestions, so please let me know...
